## Memory Subsystem
* The most common type of RAM is DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) . There each memory cell consist of Transistor and Capacitor that store the electric charge (o - no charge , 1 - charged)
* It is called dynamic because it holds the data for short time which need periodic recharging to retain the data
* DRAM has a low latency of 100 nano seconds but it is too long for modern CPU
* So that there is a small high speed memory cache called SRAM(Static Random Access Memory)
* SRAM contains 6 Interlocked Transistor which dont need refreshing and gives faster access but it need 3 times more storage than DRAM and it is more expensive
* The SRAM and DRAM are short Time memory , So there are 3 Long Time memory are there
* Magnetic Storage - 
    * It is cheapest data is stored in magnetic pattern on a spinning disc coated with magnetic film
    * It need to rotate a disc ti find the data which is 100000 times late than DRAM
* Optical based Storage - DVD , BlueRay 
    * It also uses spinning disc but it have reflective coating
    * Bits are encoded light and dark using a dys that can be read by laser
    * They are cheap and removable and have lower latence and lower capacity
* Solid State Drive - Fast ,Flash sticks
