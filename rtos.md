### GPOS(General Purpose Operating System)
* It is used to have basic usage and easily be interpreted by human beings
* It is mainly do three operations
    * Resource management - Manage hardware resource like CPU,RAM,I/O Device and allocate resource when the application needed
    * Task Scheduling - Havinng scheduling algorithm to mannage the multiple process (SJF,FCFS,RR)
    * Device Driver - Allow system to read and write from the external disc - printer
    * eg : windows,macos,linux,android  and ios
#### Disadvantage of GPOS
* It is not well suited for real time constraints which leads to higher latency
* Here the scheduler is non deterministic like when we have some deadline for some tasks to do , it won't follow and do it as it is . So this is the disadvantage and we use RTOS
* It is unsuitable for critical operations

### RTOS
* It is deterministic
* It provide high level device driver
* It is mainly used when we do concurrent task and have deadline for the task
* It has specially written scheduling algorithms
* used in shipping stations automatic emergency brake
* Super loop : A super loop is a simple program structure where tasks are executed sequentially in an infinite loop.   
    * It continuously checks and performs each task, one after the other, without any prioritization 
    * Super loops are efficient for small systems but may delay critical tasks in more complex applications.
    * It is not applicable in real time , for example we have temperatore monitoring system , in which first it reads the value throught the sensor and then print the value and turn on if the temperature is greater than 40 . All these must me happen in sequential manner and each tasks takes some time . What if i add a new funtion that add record on the log which place after the print task . So that this will take time to do so our operation maybe get affected . So that we need concurrency which RTOS have
* Advantages : 
    * Priority Task Scheduling
    * Reliability - It will finish the process on time
    * Efficiency - It requires less memory
    * Cross-Platform Support
* Disadvantages : 
    * Longer wait for low priority task
    * It is good at scheduling the small number of tasks , but it is not good at multitasking
